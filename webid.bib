  abstract = {Managing one''s memberships in different online communities more and
	more becomes a cumbersome task. This is due to the rapidly increasing
	number of communities in which we participate such as professional
	networks, sports clubs, and groups with specific interests like hobbies
	and others. In addition, these communities are scattered and distributed
	over multiple systems, i.e., different community platforms that each
	require a distinct user account. They also have different user interfaces
	and different definitions of communities and groups. In this paper,
	we present dgFOAF, an approach for distributed group management based
	on the well known Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF) vocabulary. Our dgFOAF
	approach is independent of the concrete community platforms we find
	today and needs no central server. Thus it allows for defining communities
	that span across multiple systems and thus alleviates the community
	administration task.},

	security, privacy, trust, information filtering, accountability,
	etc.; and (ii) the applicability of semantic web technologies in
	policy frameworks for other application domains such as grid computing,
	networking, storage systems, and describing norms for multiagent
	systems. {T}his workshop brings together not only researchers and

	{P}olicy management provides the openness, flexibility, and autonomy
	required to regulate this environment as entities can reason over
	their own policies and the policies of other entities to decide how
	to behave. {U}sing policies also allows entities to specify expected
	behavior of entities they interact with. {E}ntities can also adapt
	to increasingly complex requirements without the need for substantial
	changes to the structure or implementation through the use of policies.
	{P}olicy management includes policy specification, deployment, and
	reasoning over policies, updating and maintaining policies, and enforcement.},
