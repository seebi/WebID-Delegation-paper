A \textit{WebID} is a URI that refers to an Agent - Person, Robot, Group or other thing that can have Intentions.
The WebID should be a URI which when dereferenced returns a representation whose description uniquely identifies the Agent as the controller of a public key~\cite{sporny-m-2011--a}.
As a non-exclusive alternative, we propose that this description can also refer to a secretary agent WebID for access delegation.
This allows even for WebID descriptions which do not control a public key itself and only delegate access to other WebIDs (refer to \autoref{sec:WorkingGroups}).

In the context of access delegation, we distinguish a WebID which refers to an agent which has direct access to a certain resource from a WebID which refers to an agent which has access to a resource only if he acts in the name of the first agent.
We call the latter agent the \textit{secretary agent} and the first one the \textit{named agent}.

\textit{Access Delegation} is a relation between two WebID resources.
The relation describes, under which circumstances a secretary agent has access to a certain resource under the same constraints as the named agent.
The secretary agent declares to act in the name of the named agent.

\section{Requirements}

This sections lists the most crucial use-cases which require access delegation and which can not be solved with the standard WebID authentication protocol.
In addition to that, we list derived implementation requirements.

\subsection{Basic Use-Cases for Access Delegation}\label{sec:usecases}

\paragraph{Personal Devices and Applications}

Currently, the default usage intention for WebIDs are browser-based authentication scenarios.
This is an important use-case and should be of special interest but we use the world wide web not only from our browsers but also from other applications and from other application on other devices such as smartphones, tablets and freedomboxes\footnote{\url{https://freedomboxfoundation.org/}}.
In a typical every day usage scenario, we use feed readers and social network clients hand in hand with web browsers.
This is true esp. for mobile devices where specialized clients for social activities are widely in use and does exist even for academically driven social networks as the distributed Social Web \todo{A: req. explaining? (Web2.0 vs 3.0 ambiguity)} %Web2.0 or 3.0? the begining of the sentence talks about 2.0, and you end with FOAF (3.0)?
 based on FOAF WebIDs~\cite{tramp-s-2011--a}.

All these applications have in common that they act in the name of its users and fetch and manipulate resources in a way that this could also be done by the user itself and with her browser.
In a WebID-enabled communication scenario, these devices use their own certificates for communication since we do not want to copy the browser certificate to these devices and we also do not want to save the passphrase on theses devices and services.

\todo{Sebastian Tramp: Extend it with respect to the Extended Mind paper}

\paragraph{Vacation Replacement}

In a typical office scenario, employees declare vacation replacements for the time of their holiday in order to achieve an uninterruptible service during that time.
One option to allow access to this vacation replacement is to give him the original certificate or to add his private key to the users WebID.
This solution has two drawbacks: (1) the users certificate is burned after the vacation and she needs to create a new one, (2) a resource guard can not distinguish between the user and the vacation replacement user, which allows for abuse.

In this context, the named agent is the employee which is on holiday and her vacation replacement is the secretary agent.

\paragraph{Working Groups}\label{sec:WorkingGroups}
\todo{A: why 'working' and not just 'Groups'? (difference?)}
Access for working groups to a resource is typically specified in a way that each resource guard \todo{A: is it really the guard who holds the list, or some access control sys?} needs to hold a list of group members of this group.
In the Social Semantic Web \todo{A: see my prev. note about Web2.0 vs 3.0}, these working groups have its own WebID resources which describe the group as an entity and its members as relations to their user WebIDs.
To authorize a group of agents to access a resource should be as simple as to a single agent.
In order to allow this, we define the group as the named agent and all group members as its secretary agents.

An alternative could be to share one single group certificate with all members or to create a group certificate for each member and describe all public keys in the group WebID.
Again, these solutions have different drawbacks: (1) a shared certificate needs to be updated each time a user leaves the group, (2) multiple group certificates for each user does not allow for distinguishing which user accessed the resource, which allows for abuse. 

In this context, the group is the named agent and all current group members are secretary agents.\todo{A: not sure I agree (see source)}%the group is not an entity, therefore it cannot take actions by iteself. Actions are always performed by users, as part of the group.

\paragraph{Office Roles}
An office role is a construct where a user can access specific resources because of his working description.
A product manager has access to all product related resources because of her role as product manager and not because of her identity.
The role itself is identified by WebID and all access authorization rules should use this role WebID instead of a user WebID.

In this context, the role is the named agent and the current role owner is the secretary agent.

\subsection{Implementation Requirements}\label{sec:req}

Based on the given use-cases from \autoref{sec:usecases} and additional preliminary considerations, we issued the following implementation relevant requirements for an access delegation solution based on the WebID authentication protocol.

\paragraph{Distinguish secretary agents from named agents}
Delegation should not be handled by camouflaging an request of an agent in the sense that this request is indistinguishable from a named agent request.
A secretary agent should use its own certificate and it should be identified and described by its own WebID profile.
The motivation for this is twofold.
Firstly, it allows resource guards to permit or deny requests based on this information.
Secondly, applications which are secretary for many different named agents do not need to switch their certificate between requests.
Also they do not need to handle hundreds of different keys.

\paragraph{Easy to use}
The one and only place to describe which secretary agents are allowed to operate as a named agent should be the WebID profile itself.
To grant delegated access to a secretary agent, no other actions than simply adding triples to the WebID profile should be needed.
To reset this grant the same triple can removed from the WebID profile. 

\paragraph{Linked Data and Read Write Web integration}

The solution we try to architect aims to enhance the communication for consumption and modification of Linked Data esp. from the applications point of view.
This means, that existing Linked Data as well as Read-Write-Web principles should not be violated by the architecture.
\todo{what does rww means here?}

\paragraph{Minimal protocol footprint}

In addition to the integration requirement, we argue that a minimal protocol footprint should be achieved to allow a wide adoption of the extension.
This includes the requirement to not add an additional service to the process of authentication than using the existing ones.

\paragraph{No enforcement to reveal agent identities}\todo{maybe we kick this ...}
 
%Since we know that social networks play an important role in a context where communication is restricted by different parties, an 

\section{Specification of the WebID protocol extension}\label{sec:spec}

\autoref{fig:AuthSequence} depicts the process of a WebID authentication which is extended with the following components to allow access delegation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The requesting agent (the secretary) claims a request as requested in the name of a named agent (see point 2).
        This adds a HTTP request header to the specification.
    \item The WebID verifier needs to verify not only one but two different WebID incl. the relation between these two resources (see point 4).
        This adds additional verification rules to the specification.
    \item The named agent (Bob) can declare any relation to his secretary agents in his WebID profile.
        This adds a vocabulary for describing access delegation to the specification.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AuthSequence}
  \caption{Extended WebID authentication sequence}
  \label{fig:AuthSequence}
\end{figure*}

The following enumeration describe each authentication step in detail but concentrates on the context of access delegation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bob's secretary agent opens a TLS connection with the server of the protected resource.
    \item Once TLS is set up, the HTTP request is sent to the server (e.g. a \verb!HTTP GET!) to consume or manipulate a resource.
        Here our first addition comes into play, the HTTP request header to claim an request as a secretary.
        We assume that the guard intercepts this HTTP request, and requests for a client authentication (using the TLS service)
    \item This authentication request is done using public key cryptography, sign a token with the guards private key and have the secretary send its certificate.
        This is defined in the TLS protocol which is specified in \cite{dierks-t-2012--a} and its successive RFCs.
        At the end of this step, the secretaries certificate is handled back to the guard.
    \item The guard ask the verification agent to verify the WebID is named in the certificate.

        %The WebID Certificate is then passed on to the Guard with the proviso that the WebIDs still needs to be verified.
    %The Guard then must ask the Verification Agent to verify that the WebIDs do identify the agent who knows the given public key.
    %The WebID is verified by looking up the definition of the URL at its canonical location. This can be done by dereferencing it. The Verification Agent must extract the public key and all the URI entries contained in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the WebID Certificate. A WebID Certificate may contain multiple URI entries which are considered claimed WebIDs at this point, since they have not been verified. The Verification Agent may verify as many or as few WebIDs it has time for. It may do it in parallel and asynchronously. However that is done, a claimed WebIDs can only be considered verified if the following steps have been accomplished successfully:
        %If the WebID Verifier does not have an up to date version of the WebID profile in the cache, then it must dereference the WebID using the canonical method for dereferencing a URL of that scheme. For an https://... WebID this would be done using the [HTTP-TLS] protocol.
        %The returned representation is then transformed into an RDF graph as specified in Processing the WebID Profile
        %That graph is then queried as explained in Querying the Graph. If the query succeeds, then that WebID is verified.
    %With the set of verified WebIDs the Guard can then check its access control rules using information from the web and other information available to it, to verify if the referent of the WebID is indeed allowed access to the protected resource. The exact nature of those Access Control Rules is left for another specification. Suffice it to say that it can be something as simple as a lookup in a table.
    %If access is granted, then the guard can pass on the request to the protected resource, which can then interact unimpeded with the client.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedwork}

\subsection{OAuth}
\todo{Andrei Sambra: Compare to oAuth}

OAuth~2.0\footnote{http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2} is the latest version of the OAuth protocol, which is being presented as an access delegation protocol, enabling users to grant third-party access to their web resources without sharing their passwords. Even if OAuth provides authentication as a byproduct of having the resource owner authorize a client to a resource server, its main focus is on authorization rather than on federated identity.


OAuth includes two main parts: obtaining a token by asking the user to grant access, and using tokens to access protected resources (Fig.~\ref{fig:oauth2flow}). OAuth has been designed around the following client profiles:

\paragraph*{web application} -- A web application is a confidential client running on a web server. Resource owners access the client via an HTML user interface rendered in a user-agent on the device used by the resource owner.

\paragraph*{user-agent-based application} -- A user-agent-based application is a public client in which the client code is downloaded from a web server and executes within a user-agent (e.g. web browser) on the device used by the resource owner.

\paragraph*{native application} -- A native application is a public client installed and executed on the device used by the resource owner. Protocol data and credentials are accessible to the resource owner.\\

OAuth defines four basic roles: 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Oauth2.pdf}
  \caption{OAuth 2.0 protocol flow}
  \label{fig:oauth2flow}
\end{figure*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item resource owner -- An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user (i.e. you).

\item resource server -- The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

\item client -- An application which accesses a resource owner's protected resources after the resource owner has explicitly granted it permission -- this last part can also be rephrased into "after the resource owner has authorized the client to his/her protected resources".

\item authorization server -- The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.
\end{enumerate}

The OAuth protocol flow in Fig.~\ref{fig:oauth2flow} can be explained as follows:

\paragraph*{(A)} The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's user-agent to the authorization endpoint. The client includes         its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).

\paragraph*{(B)} The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner grants or denies the client's access request.

\paragraph*{(C)} Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during client registration). The redirection URI includes an authorization code and any local state provided by the client earlier.

\paragraph*{(D)} The client requests an access token from the authorization server's token endpoint by including the authorization code received in the previous step. When making the request, the client authenticates with the authorization server. The client includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization code for verification.

\paragraph*{(E)} The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the authorization code, and ensures the redirection URI received matches the URI used to redirect the client in step (C). If valid, the authorization server responds back with an access token and optionally, a refresh token. A single access token may grant varying degrees of access to multiple APIs. The set of resources and operations permitted by an access token is controlled during the access token request via a variable parameter called \textit{scope}. Several scopes may be included in a request.\\

To summarize what we have seen so far, OAuth is not exactly an access delegation protocol, but rather a protocol which authorizes a resource consumer to securely access data from a resource server. Once the access token has been created, both applications communicate directly between themselves, without any need for delegation.

We can only assume that in a non-Linked Data environment, one can take advantage of OAuth in order to create the trust relationship between a user (agent) and the secretary (cf. Listing~\ref{list:sec_relation}), while access delegation would take place at a later time.

%As opposed to WebID Access Delegation where the resource owner specifies the secretary relation using Linked Data (cf. Listing~\ref{list:sec_relation})\todo{A: Linked Data reference?}, OAuth requires a pre-existing relationship between resource consumer and resource server, in the form of a shared secret. The OAuth relationship is created by manually registering \textit{each} resource consumer with the resource server. Furthermore, explicit user consent is required each time a new resource consumer requires access to the user's resource server.
