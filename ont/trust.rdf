       The subject of the relation (known as the Principal) has as keeper of secrets that can act on its behalf
      the agent identified by the object of the relation (known as the Secretary). The Principal and Secretary 
      are relational roles played by two agents and cannot be types of agents, since the same agent could play
      both roles.
